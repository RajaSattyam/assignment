1.First we need to create 2-dimensional Array.
2.After that we have to keep track of that element position and thier neighbours 
  position and state (specially how many neighbours are in live state) 
  by this we could able to decide the state of our element.
3. Implementation of rules
   i).Loneliness : If i am live and less than 2 neighbours then new state is DIE.
   ii).Overpopulation: If I am live and more than 3 neighbours then new State is DIE.
  iii).Reproduction: If I am dead and more than 3 neighbour are live then new state is Live.
